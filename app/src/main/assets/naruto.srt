1
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:32,194
He's not in here.

2
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:40,643
He's not in here, either!

3
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,663
He's not in here, either!

4
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:58,610
Where the heck...are you?!

5
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:02,329
We've finally...made it this far!

6
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:04,687
Where are you...?!

7
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,414
Where are you?

8
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,877
Sasuke!

9
00:01:40,637 --> 00:01:41,643
Sakura, huh?

10
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:56,647
Sa...su...ke.

11
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:34,640
Sasuke...

12
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:37,667
So it's you, Naruto...?

13
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:45,898
You don't even have
parents or siblings...

14
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:48,660
What do you know about me?!

15
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,812
You've been alone from the start!

16
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:54,795
What do you know about me?! Huh?!

17
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,536
It's having the bond that
makes it painful!

18
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:05,683
You've no idea
what it's like to lose that...!

19
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:07,868
You're right.

20
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:12,286
I don't know about having
real parents or siblings...

21
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,351
If that's the case...

22
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,690
Why Naruto...?

23
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:21,677
Why do you go so far for me...?

24
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:27,603
To me, it's a bond...
I've finally been able to establish.

25
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:31,540
That's why I'll stop you!

26
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,680
If that's the case,
then why didn't you...?

27
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,667
Then I'll just break that bond!

28
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:45,950
Why didn't you kill me
back then?!

29
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,653
Is that how you wanted
to break the bond?!

30
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:50,667
Sasuke!

31
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:54,847
The reason's simple...

32
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:59,697
It's not that I couldn't break
the bond with you...

33
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:03,433
You're one who might be able

34
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,484
to use the same Mangekyo
Sharingan as mine...

35
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:11,424
However, there is one condition...

36
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:17,167
You must kill...

37
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:19,812
your closest friend.

38
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,976
It was just irritating to me.

39
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:26,978
Obtaining power according to
the method I heard about from him.

40
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:33,115
You're only alive because
of my passing whim.

41
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,600
When did he...?!

42
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:53,623
Come to think of it,

43
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:56,847
didn't you have a dream
of becoming the Hokage...?

44
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:00,247
If you had the time to
chase after me,

45
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,683
you should've spent that
time training or something...

46
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,640
Right... Naruto?

47
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,637
And that's why this time around...

48
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:11,642
You'll lose your life...

49
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:16,250
because of my passing whim.

50
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:27,777
There's no way a guy
who can't even save one friend...

51
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:29,759
can ever become the Hokage.

52
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:34,020
Isn't that right...Sasuke?

53
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,780
Sasuke...!

54
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,742
Naruto...

55
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:11,448
Show him...our...powers.

56
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,690
What's the matter...?

57
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:31,394
Why do you hesitate...?

58
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:38,507
You need my power, don't you?

59
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,647
Now then...

60
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,520
Who do you want to kill...?

61
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,630
You should know.

62
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:03,077
That you can't do anything
on your own.

63
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:04,382
SEAL

64
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,828
Break the seal completely!

65
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:11,523
I'll grant you all of my powers
if you do.

66
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,283
How...?!

67
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:25,485
I can see it now...

68
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,623
So this is your unknown power, huh...?

69
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:31,697
Who would've thought...

70
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:35,357
you'd have something like this
inside of you...

71
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:39,113
I see...
So you're an Uchiha...

72
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:42,931
My how you've grown...

73
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:48,750
To think you'd be able
to see me within Naruto...

74
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,306
That loathsome Sharingan...

75
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:55,657
So that's the power of
the cursed clan, huh?

76
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:02,075
It seems this isn't the first time
you've seen the Sharingan.

77
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:07,709
Then...you must be
the Nine-Tailed Fox, huh...?

78
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:15,385
That vision, and Chakra
more ominous than mine...

79
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:20,062
It's just like...
Madara Uchiha, from long ago...

80
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,906
Heck if I know...that person.

81
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:07,698
Homecoming

82
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:09,049
Did you find it?

83
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,657
All clear here.

84
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,667
Target acquired!

85
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,600
Uh-oh! It'll get into the village!

86
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,637
No way will we let it get away!

87
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:42,610
What the--?!

88
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,607
Where'd it go?

89
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:45,627
That way!

90
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,613
Hey, you squirts!

91
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:51,005
Hey!

92
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:52,667
W-We're sorry!

93
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:54,660
What're you doing?!

94
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,686
Sorry!

95
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:00,000
Sorry about that.

96
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,323
Ichiraku Ramen

97
00:11:02,356 --> 00:11:03,413
I'm going out for a small delivery.

98
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:06,732
Whoa! Outta the way!

99
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,474
Sorry, pops!

100
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,559
Hey, Naruto!

101
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,627
No, I mean...

102
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,650
Konohamaru!

103
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:37,505
Konohamaru!
We've cornered the target.

104
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:40,188
Hurry up.

105
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,627
It'll get away!

106
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,657
No problem!

107
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:51,660
Why you--!

108
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,617
- Give it up already!
- Konohamaru!

109
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,663
I got him!

110
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:03,670
A ribbon on the right ear...
No doubt about it.

111
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:08,044
Ebisu Sensei, we captured
the lost pet target "Dora."

112
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:10,810
Heh-heh... Mission complete!

113
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,888
Oh, my adorable Dora!

114
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:25,488
I was worried to death about you.
Where were you?

115
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:27,690
I'd want to run away too,

116
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,807
if an old lady like that
were my owner...

117
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:31,555
Konohamaru!

118
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,414
All right, here is the reward.

119
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,810
Now then, let's go home, Dora.

120
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:47,647
How many hours did it take
you guys to catch a simple lost cat?!

121
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:51,657
But that cat was incredibly quick...

122
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:53,643
And he seemed accustomed
to running away...

123
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:54,702
I don't want to hear
any excuses!

124
00:12:55,014 --> 00:13:00,034
A mission like this must be carried out
more quickly and properly!

125
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:01,299
You guys are not good enough!

126
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:06,239
I can't display my true strength
on a lame mission like this!

127
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,452
Say, Iruka Sensei.

128
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Don't you have more of
an awesome mission for me?

129
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,310
Listen... Konohamaru...

130
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:17,657
Konohamaru, you guys just
became Genin.

131
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,937
There's no way I can give missions
like that to you right off the bat, right?!

132
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:23,253
It'll be D-rank missions
until further notice.

133
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,687
I can't be satisfied with that!

134
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,421
After all, in the future

135
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,067
I'm going to become
the Seventh Hokage.

136
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:32,292
Seventh? Not the Sixth?

137
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,623
Brother Naruto's going to be the Sixth.

138
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:46,496
Brother Naruto, huh...?

139
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:49,607
I wonder where he is right now...

140
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,627
I bet he'll return having become
an awesome Shinobi.

141
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,914
I have faith in him!

142
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:04,212
He's more of a Second Naruto
than a Seventh Hokage...

143
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:08,912
Naruto... Are you holding up okay?

144
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:14,693
No matter what, I'll get strong
and bring Sasuke back!

145
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:19,650
Quite a bit of time has passed
since he said that

146
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:22,630
and went off for real training
with Master Jiraiya...

147
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:26,630
Yes. Isn't it just about the time
he should be returning?

148
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,657
We need him to return.

149
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:35,613
After all, there will probably be
significant developments sometime soon.

150
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:59,500
Hey... Could that be...?

151
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,650
Yeah... No doubt about it.

152
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:06,647
Miss Sakura!

153
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:11,568
Oh, Konohamaru!

154
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:12,657
Where are you off to?

155
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,643
The main village gate.

156
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:18,663
I have to pick up the morning pedestrian
traffic ledger for Lady Tsunade.

157
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,225
You want to come?

158
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:23,482
It's been about two and a half years.

159
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:25,670
Yeah, it has...

160
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:31,037
And then that Dora cat suddenly
starts scratching me like crazy!

161
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:35,617
We had missions like that, too.
It kind of takes me back.

162
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,670
Come to think of it,

163
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:39,623
have you heard anything
from Brother Naruto?!

164
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,667
Nothing...yet.

165
00:15:42,114 --> 00:15:43,120
I see...

166
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,620
He should be coming back soon, though...

167
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:54,680
Hello, Izumo, Kotetsu.

168
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:56,441
Oh, look who's here...

169
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:59,245
Why don't you head on into town?

170
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,346
You'll see something interesting.

171
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,603
Something interesting...?

172
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,294
Don't tell me!

173
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,342
He's having a ball...

174
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:22,856
This takes me back!
The village hasn't changed a bit!

175
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:30,115
Everyone! Naruto Uzumaki's back!

176
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:37,298
It's all so nostalgic...!

177
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:38,372
Yup! Yup!

178
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:44,596
They added GrandmaTsunade's
Mountainside Image!

179
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,046
For real...?

180
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,490
For real!

181
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,253
Naruto? Is that you, Naruto?

182
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:02,200
When did you get back, Naruto?!

183
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:04,243
Just now!

184
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,220
Long time no see, Sakura!

185
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:18,273
You've gotten taller than me,
haven't you?

186
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:19,273
Huh...?

187
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:21,963
Oh! You're right.

188
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:26,881
He kind of...got
a build since I saw him last...

189
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:32,253
So? You think I've become
a bit womanly?

190
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,287
You're fine!
You haven't changed a bit.

191
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:44,058
You just don't understand
the heart of a woman...

192
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,176
Brother Naruto!

193
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:50,994
Sexy Jutsu!

194
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:52,293
Ohh!

195
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,835
Wha--?!

196
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:59,334
How about that?!
Pretty nice waist, hips and bust, huh?!

197
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:07,883
Konohamaru...
I'm not a kid anymore.

198
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:12,303
And you too, shouldn't be using Jutsu...
like that...

199
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:21,046
That's right. It isn't just
your appearance that's matured...

200
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:24,964
I kind of feel a bit lonesome,

201
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:28,243
but you've turned out quite admirable,
haven't you, Naruto?

202
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:33,250
Knowing you, I bet you came back
having acquired some incredible Jutsu.

203
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:36,746
That's such a boring Jutsu!

204
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:40,877
Check out my freshly
developed New Pervy Ninjutsu!

205
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:44,145
Right... Like the New Pervy Ninjutsu...

206
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:45,212
Here we go!

207
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:50,649
Hey, you idiot!

208
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:05,250
You haven't changed at all,
have you, you jerk?!

209
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:07,263
After seeing each other for
the first time in like two years!

210
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,297
You make me do this
in barely two minutes!

211
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,210
What am I supposed to do

212
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:14,203
with the feelings of admiration
I had for you earlier, huh?!

213
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:16,290
- That short temper and incredible strength.
- I'm not the least bit lonesome!

214
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:19,513
- She's a second-generation Tsunade.
- Huh? God, I'm mad at myself!

215
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,821
Just like I thought,
Sakura hasn't changed at all...

216
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:25,577
In fact, I get the feeling she's
even more vicious than before...

217
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,641
Huh? Did you say something?

218
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,989
It's been a long time, you two.

219
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm sure your training produced
good results, right?

220
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:39,069
Do you think we came back
without making progress?

221
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,237
It went perfectly!

222
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,367
Then show me those
results immediately.

223
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:45,846
Show you...?

224
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,263
You will take on a particular man.

225
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:51,733
I didn't send him on any missions
for the past several days

226
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,248
and had him standby
for this very purpose.

227
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:55,810
Your opponent will be...

228
00:19:58,647 --> 00:19:59,637
Come in!

229
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:05,508
Oh!

230
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,540
Today at around five
in the afternoon,

231
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:41,560
Security Ninja were found collapsed

232
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,590
at the fortress of
the Village Hidden in the Sand.

233
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,560
No signs of dispute were found
within the scene of the crime;

234
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:49,587
leading officials to believe
the crime might have been committed

235
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,543
by someone in the village,
or a skilled intruder.

236
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:55,540
Around the same time,
there have been reported sightings

237
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:58,593
of two men dressed in black clothing
with red cloud patterns.

238
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:01,547
They are likely connected
to the incident.

239
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,547
Next time:
